    <h3>San Sebastian College - Recoletos de Cavite</h3>
    <p>The Augustinian Recollects, driven by the "Spirit of Reform" in Christianity, emerged in the late 16th century with a focus on strict adherence to the Rule of St. Augustine. Initially, they pursued a contemplative life but later engaged in missionary work, particularly in the Philippines. In 1606, they established missions across the Philippine archipelago, including in Cavite, where they built a church and convent. Over time, they expanded their educational efforts, founding San Sebastian Junior College in 1966. Facing competition, they diversified their offerings, including Computer Science and admitting female students. Despite challenges from larger universities, they expanded their course offerings and infrastructure. The institution gained accreditation for various programs and supported the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, offering Senior High School programs. They aim to maintain quality education while adapting to changing educational landscapes.</p>
